* The latex.* functions in the microplot package place their graphics
  files in a directory inside the working directory with the same
  basename as the generated .tex or .docx file.  A new function
  dir.verify makes sure the directory exists.

* The microplot.* functions place their graphics files in filenames
  specified by the figPrefix argument.  These functions rely on the
  calling latex() or msWord() function to make it a subdirectory.

* new function: latexSetOptions.  Defaults to "pdflatex".

* define dvi.latexConsole to put latex console output in a file.

* new classes msWordFilename and htmlFilename, and print methods that
  call system(paste("open", x))

* msWord and latex and msWord can now uses label.x.axis and
  label.y.axis distinct from xlab and ylab.

* New function microplotAttrDisplay called by microplot() determines
  if the axis and key microplots are attributes or placed into the
  matrix of filenames.

* tighten up `[.microplotMatrix` and `[.includegraphicsMatrix`, and
  attributes for both, and documentation.

* change png default to res=600 and make res a new argument to microplot.

* use cowplot to index into individual panels in ggplot and to get the
  ggplot legend.  I now illustrate equivalent capabilities with
  lattice and ggplot.

* redesigned microplot.AEdotplot, latex.AEdotplot, msWord.AEdotplot.
  These are now models for complex graphic structures.

* AEdotplotMethods.R function microplot.AEdotplot now produces
  class microplotMatrix in both latex and msWord.

* demo/AEdoplotr.r uses latex.includegraphicsMatrix and
  msWord.microplotMatrix.

* both msWord.microplotMatrix and demo/LegendrePolynomials-MSWord.r
  have explicit tests for mingw32.  UTF-8 text strings (for Greek
  letters) can't easily be used on Windows.

* Not yet done:  Write paper for R Journal, or JCGS

* 2018 Jan 08

* 1.0-25 on CRAN 2018-01-10

* New latex methods for trellis and ggplot.  latex.trellis and
  latex.ggplot methods for one- and two-dimension objects. The latex
  generic accepts, and forwards, all arguments to microplot and
  as.includegraphics.

* New generic function MSWord() with trellis and ggplot methods (based
  on ReporteRs package).

* New generic function microplot() with complete set of methods for
  trellis and ggplot.

* Improved as.includegraphics(), now a generic with methods and
  attributes.

* import and re-export latex and dvi generics.

* microplot() has new collapse argument to zero out unwanted
  layout.heights and layout.widths space in lattice and provide a
  theme_collapse for ggplot.

* AEdotplot methods and demos for latex() and MSWord()

* demo/LegendrePolynomials, example of matrix of panels with lots of
  control at the panel level

* Replace previous demo/timeseries.r with a more interesting
  timeseries example containing a collection of rearrangements of a
  set of annual plots.  The demo illustrates arranging a vector of
  panels into a matrix, and control of the placement of common axes in
  the LaTeX table containing the individual panels.

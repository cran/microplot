Version: 1.0-25
---------------

* 2018 Jan 8

* all examples and demos now work with code revisions.


Version: 1.0-24
---------------

* 2018 Jan 04

* completed redesign of latex.trellis, microplot.trellis, as.includegraphics

* demo/LegendrePolynomials, example of matrix of panels with lots of
  control at the panel level

* simplified coding of example demo/LPrevised.r

* really good version of LegendrePolynomials.r

* Use c.trellis and cbind.trellis to put individual panels into
  trellis matrix structure and then use latex.trellis on that.
  Use collapse=() argument to maintain individual appearances on the panels.

* latex method for class microplotMatrix

* prepare for eventual class includegraphicsMatrix, that may actually never be needed.

* key now handled sensibly, with a few more interconnected arguments.

* as.includegraphics kern arguments renamed to hspace.left and hspace.right

* feeeze as is, and start documentation on 1.0-25


Version: 1.0-23
---------------

* 2017 Dec 29

* Move orientation of trellis plots from latex.trellis() to
  microplot.trellis().  microplot.trellis honors the as.table
  component of the trellis object.  microplot.trellis() handles
  tranposed trellis arguments correctly.

* Eventually latex.trellis and latex.ggplot will become essentially
  identical, both being wrappers for latex.microplot, with the real
  differences happening in the microplot.trellis and microplot.ggplot
  functions.

* New argument to latex.trellis: return.value=c("latex","R").  Setting
  return.value="R" will return the matrix of LaTeX statements that
  would otherwise be sent to latex for processing.  Returning them
  here allows the user to cbind the columns with numerical matrices.

* Add scale argument to as.includegraphics.  Change default value of
  height argument to height=NULL in as.includegraphics.

* New arguments to microplot.trellis: height.x.axis=height, width.y.axis=width,


Version: 1.0-22
---------------

* 2017 Dec 27

* Tighten up demos so they don't need library(Hmisc)

* Add new arguments to as.includegraphics, primarily to allow for
  horizontal and vertical control of the positioning of the axes.

* Add new arguments x.axis, y.axis, height.as, width.as, raise, kern
  to latex.trellis that will be forwarded to as.includegraphics.

* Replace previous demo/timeseries.r with a more interesting
  timeseries example containing a collection of rearrangements of a
  set of annual plots.  The demo illustrates arranging a vector of
  panels into a matrix, and control of the placement of common axes in
  the LaTeX table containing the individual panels.

* microplot arguments height and width now default to 1 (numeric, inches).


Version: 1.0-21
---------------

* 2017 Dec 23

* microplot.trellis has new collapse argument for function which will zero out unwanted
  layout.heights and layout.widths space.

* latex.trellis uses collapse argument

* axis now works for both x and y

* removed target argument

* removed most microplot.ggplot placeholder functions

* now passes --run-dontrun

* still needs a few functions documented



Version: 1.0-20
---------------

* 2017 Dec 18

* microplot.trellis: include all device options in the microplot.trellis function itself.


Version: 1.0-19
---------------

* 2017 Dec 18

* latex.trellis for one- and two-dimension "trellis" objects.


Version: 1.0-18
---------------

* 2017 Jul 29

* microplot and microplot.xxx methods improved.

* microplot.trellis handles a "trellis" object tt with (length(dim(tt)) == 2)

* Functions introduced in 1.0-17 are now documented.

* NAMESPACE

* more demos


Version: 1.0-17
---------------

* 2017 Jun 26

* generic function microplot() with complete set of methods for
  lattice, and examples of methods for ggplot2.

* generic function MSWord() with several specialized methods (based on
  ReporteRs package).

* AEdotplot methods and demos for latex() and MSWord()

* as.includegraphics retains attributes of argument (especially dim
  and dimnames)


Version: 1.0-16
---------------

* on CRAN: 2017-01-19

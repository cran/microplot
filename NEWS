Version: 1.0-45
---------------

* 2022 Jan 26

* vignette needed updating to catch up with nd <- names(dimnames(TrellisObject))
  outer=TRUE gives a value to nd[[1]], but not nd[[2]].

* updated two https references


Version: 1.0-44
---------------

* 2020 Nov 28

* msWord.microplotMatrix: flextable::display is defunct.  Replaced
  with flextable::compose which uses different, and much simpler,
  argument list.

* dvi.latexConsole.R and show.latexConsole.Rd: Revised
  print.OSfilename() and show.OSfilename() to use wait=FALSE as default,
  hence the printing will be asynchronous.

* NAMESPACE: importFrom more functions from flextable.

* microplot.Rd: arguments to microplot.trellis needed adjusting.

* cc176.y.adj.Rd: change http to https

* CRAN: 2020-11-29


Version: 1.0-43
---------------

* 2020 Jun 16

* latex.graphicsClass now declared as S3 method

* latex.trellis.Rd: repair typo

* microplot.trellis: height.panel and width.panel can now be vectors.

* microplot.trellis: {height.x.axis width.y.axis height.xlab
  width.ylab} are taken from the upperleft panel and used for all
  panels.  This is OK under (a) the standard situation when all panels
  have the same height and width; (b) under the special situation when
  all columns of panels have the same width, all panels in each row of
  panels have the same height, and there is exactly one tick mark in
  each row; (c) the transpose of (b); and (d) all panels in each
  column have the same width, all panels in each row have the same
  height, and there is exactly one tick mark in each row and column.

* as.includegraphics.default: setting {height.x.axis width.y.axis
  height.xlab width.ylab} in the list(...) to 0, now sets
  {x.axis.includegraphics y.axis.includegraphics xlab.includegraphics
  ylab.includegraphics} to FALSE.

* microplot.trellis: setting {height.x.axis width.y.axis height.xlab
  width.ylab} to 0 now suppresses the return of names of axis.names and
  lab.names files.


Version: 1.0-42
---------------

* 2018 Aug 18

* msWord.microplotMatrix: additional checks needed before calling flextable::merge_at

* CRAN: 2018-08-19


Version: 1.0-41
---------------

* 2018 Jul 18

* restore msWord methods.
  Change dependence of msWord.microplotMatrix from ReporteRs to
  flextable and officer for production of MS Word documents.

* add new arguments to demo/tablesPlusGraphicColumn.r

* adjust argument values in demo/AEdotplot.r, demo/LegendrePolynomials.r

* CRAN: 2018-07-18


Version: 1.0-40
---------------

* 2018 Jul 14

* The msWord methods are temporarily disabled, and replaced by a
  warning, in microplot_1.0-40.  All other features of microplot
  continue to work.

  msWord depends on the ReporteRs package which was archived on July 16, 2018.
  The functions in the replacement package flextable have different
  calling sequences and I haven't worked out the details yet.
  In the meantime, please use the older release microplot_1.0-39
  along with the archived ReporteRs.

* repair typos in demo/iris.r

* CRAN: 2018-07-15


Version: 1.0-39
---------------

* 2018 Jun 04

* coordinate with ggplot2_2.3.0: facet_grid() now produces an empty
  named list for unspecified column (previously NULL).

* ggplot2::geom_point() requires shape= to be inside aes().

* on CRAN: 2018-06-05



Version: 1.0-38
---------------

* 2018 Mar 12

* smooth out DESCRIPTION and ?microplot-package.  Incorporate tutorial

* The latex.* functions in the microplot package place their graphics
  files in a directory inside the working directory with the same
  basename as the generated .tex or .docx file.  A new function
  dir.verify makes sure the directory exists.

* The microplot.* functions place their graphics files in filenames
  specified by the figPrefix argument.  These functions rely on the
  calling latex() or msWord() function to make it a subdirectory.

* new function: latexSetOptions.  Defaults to "pdflatex".

* define dvi.latexConsole to put latex console output in a file.

* new classes msWordFilename and htmlFilename, and print methods that
  call system(paste("open", x))

* msWord and latex and msWord can now uses label.x.axis and
  label.y.axis distinct from xlab and ylab.

* New function microplotAttrDisplay called by microplot() determines
  if the axis and key microplots are attributes or placed into the
  matrix of filenames.

* tighten up `[.microplotMatrix` and `[.includegraphicsMatrix`, and
  attributes for both, and documentation.

* change png default to res=600 and make res a new argument to microplot.

* use cowplot to index into individual panels in ggplot and to get the
  ggplot legend.  I now illustrate equivalent capabilities with
  lattice and ggplot.

* redesigned microplot.AEdotplot, latex.AEdotplot, msWord.AEdotplot.
  These are now models for complex graphic structures.

* AEdotplotMethods.R function microplot.AEdotplot now produces
  class microplotMatrix in both latex and msWord.

* demo/AEdoplotr.r uses latex.includegraphicsMatrix and
  msWord.microplotMatrix.

* both msWord.microplotMatrix and demo/LegendrePolynomials-MSWord.r
  have explicit tests for mingw32.  UTF-8 text strings (for Greek
  letters) can't easily be used on Windows.

* Not yet done:  Write paper for R Journal, or JCGS

Version: 1.0-25
---------------

* 2018 Jan 08

* 1.0-25 on CRAN 2018-01-10

* New latex methods for trellis and ggplot.  latex.trellis and
  latex.ggplot methods for one- and two-dimension objects. The latex
  generic accepts, and forwards, all arguments to microplot and
  as.includegraphics.

* New generic function MSWord() with trellis and ggplot methods (based
  on ReporteRs package).

* New generic function microplot() with complete set of methods for
  trellis and ggplot.

* Improved as.includegraphics(), now a generic with methods and
  attributes.

* import and re-export latex and dvi generics.

* microplot() has new collapse argument to zero out unwanted
  layout.heights and layout.widths space in lattice and provide a
  theme_collapse for ggplot.

* AEdotplot methods and demos for latex() and MSWord()

* demo/LegendrePolynomials, example of matrix of panels with lots of
  control at the panel level

* Replace previous demo/timeseries.r with a more interesting
  timeseries example containing a collection of rearrangements of a
  set of annual plots.  The demo illustrates arranging a vector of
  panels into a matrix, and control of the placement of common axes in
  the LaTeX table containing the individual panels.

AEdotplot HH::AEdotplot displayed in both latex and msWord.
LegendrePolynomials Matrix of multi-line plots with LaTeX math annotation and also with MS Word.
NTplot      A matrix of normal and t plots, showing increase of power as the degrees of freedom goes up and as the distance  (mu_a - mu_0) increases.  This example uses HH::NTplot, lattice, and Hmisc::latex.
boxplot-ggplot   A column of box plots, one for each row of summary data.  This demo uses ggplot2, latex and MS Word.
bwplot-lattice  A column of box plots, one for each row of summary data.  This demo uses lattice, latex and MS Word.

latex latex of 2D and 1D trellis objects.
msWord MS Word of 2D and 1D trellis objects.
tablesPlusGraphicColumn Latex and MS Word tables with a single column of graphics.  The example shows a HH::likert plot of Toxicity data.

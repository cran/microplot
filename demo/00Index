bwplot-lattice  A column of box plots, one for each row of summary data.  This demo uses lattice and HMisc::latex.
boxplot-ggplot   A column of box plots, one for each row of summary data.  This demo uses ggplot2 and HMisc::latex.
NTplot      A matrix of normal and t plots, showing increase of power as the degrees of freedom goes up and as the distance  (mu_a - mu_0) increases.  This example uses HH::NTplot, lattice, and Hmisc::latex.
iris        A matrix of boxplots for the measurements by species of the iris data.  This example uses lattice and Hmisc::latex.
bwplot-lattice-MSWord A column of box plots, one for each row of summary data.  This demo uses lattice and ReporteRs.
boxplot-ggplot-MSWord A column of box plots, one for each row of summary data.  This demo uses ggplot2 and ReporteRs.
AEdotplot-latex  Display the graph produced by the HH::AEdotplot function in a LaTeX table along with numerical values from which the graph was constructed.  This example uses HH, lattice, Hmisc::latex.
AEdotplot-MSWord Display the graph produced by the HH::AEdotplot function in an MS Word table along with numerical values from which the graph was constructed.  This example uses HH, lattice, ReporteRs.
tablesPlusGraphicColumn Latex and MS Word tables with a single column of graphics.  The example shows a HH::likert plot.
latex latex of 2D and 1D trellis objects.
timeseries  Various rearrangements of a set of annual plots.  The demo illustrates arranging a vector of panels into a matrix, and control of placement of common axes in the LaTeX table containing the individual panels.
LegendrePolynomials Matrix of multi-line plots with LaTeX math annotation.
